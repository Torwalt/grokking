package redblacktree

// Red-Black Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of self balancing binary search tree.
// A binary search tree consists of Nodes which have up to 2 children. The
// children are ordered so that the value of a left child is lower than the
// value of the right child. A BST can become unbalanced if the heights of the
// left and right subtrees differ significantly leading to the BST degrading to
// a linked list.
// Multiple self balancing strategies exist to prevent such cases, e.g. Red-Black BSTs.
